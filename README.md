# Chrome-Dinosaur-Game
Extension of Ania Kub√≥w's tutorial at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ6lYd6dyTI

The original game was based on Chrome's dinosaur game that pops up when you're offline. That version has the dinosaur travelling across a desert and having to jump over cacti. This version has a dragon having to jump over curling rocks being thrown at him. And you can optionally play on the moon.

Since the tutorial uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript with no other packages, this does too.
